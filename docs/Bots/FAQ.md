    1. Authorisation Error: 

- This is when your token is incorrect. To fix this, you go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.dev), and go `Applications > {YOUR BOT NAME} > Bot > Reset Token`. This will reset your token for you to copy it into the config file.

    2. "Config.json does not exist":

- This is where you do not rename config.json correctly. Rename it on Ubuntu/Debian with `sudo cp config.json.example config.json`. Consult your distributions documentation or package manager to find the method of renaming your files if you are not running Ubuntu or Debian.
